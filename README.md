# peerpesa request network dapp

A PeerPesa Request Network dApp for loans could be a decentralized application (dApp) built with ReactJS and TypeScript to enable peer-to-peer (P2P) financial transactions such as requesting and managing loans on the blockchain. 

Below is a detailed description of its architecture and functionality:

## Features
## User Authentication

Wallet-based login using Web3 providers like MetaMask or WalletConnect.
Optional email/mobile verification for enhanced security.
Loan Request

Borrowers can create loan requests specifying:
Loan amount.
Repayment period.
Interest rate.
Collateral (if required).
Smart contracts ensure transparency and immutability of loan terms.
Loan Offers

Lenders can browse active loan requests.
Option to negotiate terms or accept a request.
Repayment Management

Borrowers can make repayments in milestones or lump sums.
Automated notifications/reminders for upcoming repayment deadlines.
Collateral Handling

Integration with the Stellar blockchain (or other supported blockchain) for managing collateralized loans.
Escrow smart contracts lock collateral until repayment is completed.
Analytics Dashboard

Displays loan status, payment history, and creditworthiness scores.
Real-time blockchain data visualization using libraries like react-chartjs-2 or recharts.
Decentralized Governance

Voting mechanism for disputes or protocol upgrades.
Community-managed interest rates and terms.
Tokenization

Issue unique tokens representing loan agreements.
Tokens can be traded or staked in a secondary market.
Tech Stack

## Frontend:
ReactJS: Component-based UI for dynamic interactions.
TypeScript: Type safety for robust development.
Web3.js or Ethers.js: Interact with blockchain smart contracts.

## Backend:
Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity for Ethereum or Rust for Solana.
Blockchain Integration: Stellar for collateral management or Ethereum for loan agreements.
IPFS: Decentralized storage for loan terms and metadata.

## Database:
NoSQL (e.g., Firebase) or The Graph for indexing blockchain data.
Tools and Libraries:

## Modern, responsive UI design.
React Query: State management.
Chart.js or D3.js: Data visualization.
Testing and Deployment:
Hardhat: Smart contract testing and deployment.

Jest: Frontend unit testing.
Netlify or Vercel: Hosting React dApp.
Workflow
User Interaction

Users connect their wallets and create loan requests or offers.
UI components dynamically update based on blockchain state.
Smart Contract Execution

Loan terms are deployed on the blockchain when both parties agree.
Escrow handles collateral securely.
Data Storage and Retrieval

Off-chain data is stored on IPFS or Firebase.
On-chain data is indexed using The Graph for fast retrieval.
Notifications

Push notifications alert users about due dates or changes in loan terms.

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
